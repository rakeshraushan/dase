steps for using DASe as a lightweight framework:

1. copy fresh svn sources into target dir in doc root
2. delete all files under lib/Dase/Handler
3. delete all files under lib/Dase/DBO
4. delete all files under template
5. set db configs in inc/local_config.php
6. set init_gloabl_data app setting to false 
7. run bin/class_gen.php to create models (assuming db tables are already in place)
8. in order to use ONE handler for whole app: 
	- create a file 'handler.php' in base dir class: Dase_Handler_Default
