1. Check the source code out of subversion: svn checkout
http://dase.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ dase-read-only

2. place the directory (probably renamed 'dase') somewhere in the
docroot, and open the .htaccess file and make sure the RewriteBase
is properly set (if the directory is called 'dase', and it lives at
<docroot>/dase, the RewriteBase would be '/dase')

3. Make sure you have an empty mysql database set up and you know the
path,name,username, and password.

4. make the 'dase/cache' directory apache-writeable, and create an empty
file 'dase/log/dase.log' and make it apache-writeable

5. Point a web browser at the directory and follow instructions (note
that you'll need apache-writeable media repository somewhere on the file system)
