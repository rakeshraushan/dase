Lucy is a 3.2 million year old fossil hominid, a close relative of humans. Her species, Australopithecus afarensis, is now extinct. Lucy's official museum number is AL 288-1.  She was found in 1974 by a team of French and American anthropologists at the Hadar Site in Ethiopia. While today this site is a desert, three million years ago it was a large lake surrounded by trees. 40% of Lucy's skeleton was recovered, an astonishing feat for a fossil so old.

The bones of recovered of Lucy include pieces of the skull, lower jaw, ribs, vertebrae, arm and leg bones, and hip bones. We know Lucy is a female because the shape of her hip bones resembles that of modern human females. Lucy's knee also resembles modern humans, which is bent inwards and not straight like in chimpanzees. This is an indication of bipedalism, meaning that she walked on two legs. However, other bones suggest that she spent time in trees as well as on ground. For more information on Lucy click here.

							<h1>Zhoukoudian 800-400ka</h1>
							<p> situated 50 kilometers to the southwest of Beijing proper, is the former residence of Peking man, who lived here approximately 200,000 to 500,000 years ago. Since the discovery of a complete skull on December 2,1929, Zhoukoudian, which had more recently been noted for its production of lime, became world-famous as the "home of the Chinese ape-man." After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the number of sightseers and scientists increased rapidly, and Zhoukoudian has become a great tourist attraction.

							<h1>Hadar 3.4-2.8ma</h1>
						<p>The Hadar site is located in the Afar triangle region of Ethiopia (shown in inset, right). It was discovered in 1968 along the Kada Hadar and Ounda Hadar tributaries of the Awash River.
The site itself sits in a large sedimentary basin between the Ethiopian Escarpment and the volcanic axis of the central Afar. The sediments at Hadar accumulated over a period that spanned the late Miocene to the early Pleistocene.
