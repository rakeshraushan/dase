steps for using DASe as a lightweight framework:

1. copy fresh svn sources into target dir in doc root
2. delete all files under lib/Dase/Handler
3. delete all files under lib/Dase/DBO
4. delete all files under template
5. set db configs in inc/local_config.php
6. in lib/Dase.php comment out line setting app_data
7. run bin/class_gen.php to create models (assuming db tables are already in place)
8. in order to use ONE handler for whole app: 
	- create a file 'handler.php' in base dir
	- declare handler class based on default handler name
	- e.g. id default_handler is my_app, declare class Dase_Handler_MyApp
