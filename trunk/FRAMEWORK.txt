steps for using DASe as a lightweight framework:

1. copy fresh svn sources into target dir in doc root
2. delete all files under lib/Dase/Handler
3. delete all files under lib/Dase/DBO
4. delete all files under template
5. set db configs in inc/local_config.php
7. run bin/class_gen.php to create models (assuming db tables are already in place)
8. go nuts
