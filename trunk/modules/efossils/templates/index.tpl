<p>&lt;p&gt;In 1974, a team of French and American anthropologists were searching for fossils at the Hadar site, Ethiopia, in east Africa.  While making maps of areas where fossils had previously been found, two scientists named Tom Gray and Donald Johanson found many fossilized bones belonging to a single individual.  This individual was nicknamed "Lucy," after the Beatles' song, "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds."  Lucy’s official museum number is AL 288-1.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Lucy is a fossil &lt;def&gt;hominin&lt;/def&gt;, a close relative of humans.  Her species, &lt;i&gt;Australopithecus afarensis&lt;/i&gt;, is now extinct.&lt;/p&gt;  

&lt;p&gt;Geologists found that Lucy lived about 3.2 &lt;def&gt;Mya&lt;/def&gt;.  Today, the area where she lived, known as Hadar, is a desert.  Three million years ago, at Hadar there was a large lake surrounded by trees.  

&lt;p&gt;Astonishingly, Lucy is 40% complete.  This means that about 40% of her skeleton was recovered, which is a lot for a fossil as old as she.    The bones include pieces of the skull, lower jaw, ribs, vertebrae, arm and leg bones, and hip bones.  Because there are so many bones available, physical anthropologist are able to learn a great deal about Lucy and about her species.  For example, we know Lucy is a female because the shape of her hip bones resembles that of modern human females.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;When she was fully grown, Lucy stood only &lt;fn&gt;107 centimeters (3'6") tall&lt;/fn&gt;!  A male &lt;i&gt;Australopithecus afarensis&lt;/i&gt; would have stood taller, perhaps over four feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that anthropologists look at when studying fossil hominins is cranial capacity.  This measures the space where the brain sits.  Lucy’s brain was only medium size, about the size of a modern chimpanzee's.  It was not as large as a modern human's brain.  How big the brain is compared to body size can tell us about growth and biology, but a larger brain does not really mean that a person is smarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did Lucy walk?  Anthropologists say that when an animal walks on two legs, like humans, it is &lt;def&gt;bipedal&lt;/def&gt;.  Lucy's knee looks like a modern human, which is bent inwards and not straight like in modern chimpanzees.  This bent knee helps us to center our weight and not fall over when we stand up straight.  So, Lucy probably walked like we do on the ground.  However, other bones suggest that Lucy and her species spent time in the trees, too.  The finger bones of &lt;i&gt;Australopithecus afarensis&lt;/i&gt; are curved to help grasp tree branches; this is seen in other apes that climb trees.  The shape of the wrist bones and the shoulder also suggest that Lucy spent time climbing.  All of this evidence helped anthropologists piece together the puzzle of how Lucy walked.  She spent time walking on two legs on the ground, but probably just as much time (if not more) climbing in trees.  Trees would have been a safe place for Lucy to sleep at night and to hide from predators, such as cheetahs and leopards.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
