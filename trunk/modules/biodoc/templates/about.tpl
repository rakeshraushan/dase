Bio-DOC was conceived by two Biological Sciences faculty members in the College of Natural Sciences at the University of Texas at Austin: Dr. K Sata
Sathasivan, Senior Lecturer and Dr. Daniel Bolnick, Assistant Professor.
Development of Bio-DOC is made possible by the <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/academic/cit/fasttex/index.html">~FAST Tex</a> program in the
Division of Instructional Innovation and Assessment funded by the Information Technology Fee, a student-supported resource.
The students who have developed the site are Sumit Srivastava, Anthony Maggio, and Sivaramakrishnan Radhakrishnan.
