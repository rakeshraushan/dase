#summary some notes on category schemes

== Atom Categories ==

scheme uri is used in atom:category@scheme, but can also be used in atom:link@rel when atom:link@href expresses a query of all (pertinent) entities with a corresponding atom:category@scheme with a @term tthat matches the atom:id of the entity holding the atom:link.

note: terms should (often) be an atom:id and if/when they are, automatically set up a child-to-parent relationship with that atom entity, a relationship defined by the scheme.

So...if I use categories for DASe metadata, the term would be the atom:id of the attribute. e.g.: 
{{{
<category term="http://www.laits.utexas.edu/dasebeta/attribute/test/description" label="Description" scheme="http://daseproject.org/schema/attribute">This is a really cool picture of a really cool thing</category>
}}}
nice (also solves problem of instance - specific scheme).

idea -- what if "everything is an entry" in DASe (feeds, categories, attributes, items, item_types, set) and had three standard views: entry, category, feed.  Any entity could be made child of another by means of a category w/ term that was the atom:id of the parent (entry).   

thought -- categories are the current version of @rev in an html link. http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/links.html#adef-rev.  It defines a link back to here. (??).  Or maybe it is just different "kind" of link -- one that suggests a child of a parent.

so how do we attach a budget item to a grant proposal?

application has many budget items. application and budget_item are item_types. We related these in the database. Each budget_item has this category (w/ item_type you need to note relationship in scheme uri)
{{{
<category scheme="http://www.laits.utexas.edu/dasebeta/item_type/grants/application/rel/budget_item" term="http://www.laits.utexas.edu/dasebeta/item/grants/000123"/>
}}}
and application has this link:
{{{
<link rel="http://www.laits.utexas.edu/dasebeta/item_type/grants/application/rel/budget_item" term="http://www.laits.utexas.edu/dasebeta/search/grants/000123"/>
}}}



==== question: how are schemes established? ====


=== from wiki:===

scheme prefix is: http://daseproject.org/category/

based on intrinsic factors:
  * error (error)
  * collection  (collection_ascii_id)
  * collection/item_count
  * entrytype (attribute | collection | item | set)
  * feedtype (collection | collection_list | search | item | tag)
  * item/type (type_ascii_id)
  * tag/count (count of items)
  *  position (integer)

can be "set" dynamically (either not required, or there is an obvious default value)
  * collection/visibility (manager | user | public)
  * tag/background (color or hex code)
  * tag/type (set | slideshow | cart | admin)
  * tag/visibility (owner | user | public)
  * attribute/html_input_type ('text'|'textarea'|'radio'|'checkbox'|'select'|'listbox'|'no_edit'|'text_with_menu)
  * item/status (public | draft | delete )
tbd: split out read access and write access.
