#summary some notes on category schemes

== Atom Categories ==

scheme uri is used in atom:category@scheme, but can also be used in atom:link@rel when atom:link@href expresses a query of all (pertinent) entities with a corresponding atom:category@scheme with a @term tthat matches the atom:id of the entity holding the atom:link.

note: terms should (often) be an atom:id and if/when they are, automatically set up a child-to-parent relationship with that atom entity, a relationship defined by the scheme.

So...if I use categories for DASe metadata, the term would be the atom:id of the attribute. e.g.: 
{{{
<category term="http://www.laits.utexas.edu/dasebeta/attribute/test/description" label="Description" scheme="http://daseproject.org/schema/attribute">This is a really cool picture of a really cool thing</category>
}}}
nice (also solves problem of instance - specific scheme).



==== question: how are schemes established? ====


=== from wiki:===

scheme prefix is: http://daseproject.org/category/

based on intrinsic factors:
  * error (error)
  * collection  (collection_ascii_id)
  * collection/item_count
  * entrytype (attribute | collection | item | set)
  * feedtype (collection | collection_list | search | item | tag)
  * item/type (type_ascii_id)
  * tag/count (count of items)
  *  position (integer)

can be "set" dynamically (either not required, or there is an obvious default value)
  * collection/visibility (manager | user | public)
  * tag/background (color or hex code)
  * tag/type (set | slideshow | cart | admin)
  * tag/visibility (owner | user | public)
  * attribute/html_input_type ('text'|'textarea'|'radio'|'checkbox'|'select'|'listbox'|'no_edit'|'text_with_menu)
  * item/status (public | draft | delete )
tbd: split out read access and write access.
