 * each DASe deployment (a.k.a. archive) is comprised of Collections
 * each Collection contains Items and an Item can only be in one collection
 * Items have Media Files associated with them and a Media File can only be associated with one Item.  Typical, multiple files will represent different representations of the same resource (e.g., a small, medium, and large version of an image)
 * Items have metadata associated with them.  The metadata takes the form of key-value pairs.  (DASe uses the word "attribute" instead of "key").
