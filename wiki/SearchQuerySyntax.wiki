#summary The DASe URL-based search interface allows users to query an archive for items.  The search results can be returned as an Atom feed or a JSON serialization.

=search syntax:=
  * query name is 'q'
  * include phrases in quotes (' or ")
  * use '-' to omit a word or phrase
  * for attribute searches, name is '<coll_ascii_id>~<attribute_ascii_id>'
  * use tilde (as in example) for auto substring/phrase search
  * use single period to match exact value_text string (case-insensitive)
  * add more attribute searches (refinements) by adding them to the query string. Note that the use of '.' or '~' in a query parameter name that is NOT part of the search will make the search fail (since it'll be interpreted as an attribute search
 
  * also...prepend query term with att_ascii_id to limit to that attribute ascii (allows cross-coll searches!) that's the 'qualified' search 
 
  * NOTE: everything is assumed to be "and."
  * The word 'and' has *no* boolean significance. 
  * Parentheses have not functional significance.
