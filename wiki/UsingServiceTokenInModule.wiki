#summary description of using a service token in a module

The Grant Proposal Application Module (itsprop) is required to do operations on the underlying DASe collection that the logged in user is not authorized to do.  If the operations are done strictly within the handler (or other PHP code), we can simply embed the serviceuser and password in the code.  But when the browser needs to do such operations, we need a (relatively) secure way for the browser to access the serviceuser password.  The step are shown here.

  * Create a serviceuser by setting a config variable in the module's local config file ({module_root}/inc/config.php):

{{{
$conf['serviceuser']['itsprop'] = 'ok'  //'ok' can be anything that evaluates to true
}}}

  * On the layout template, include a link w/ rel=service_pass and href that will point to a resource in the module which will return the service password and will require a valid logged-in user to do so

{{{
<link rel="service_pass" href="{$module_root}service_pass/itsprop" />
}}}
