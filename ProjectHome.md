## What is DASe? ##

DASe (Digital Archive Services) is a lightweight digital asset repository.  DASe provides a platform for users to store, catalog, aggregate, and share images, audio, video, and documents.  End-users can search or browse items in DASe, and can create "sets" to save, share or present in a simple slideshow format.  DASe also includes an administrative interface for creating new collections, uploading new items, and adding metadata to existing items.

In addition to the web interface, all of the DASe functionality is available through Atom/AtomPub web services.

DASe was developed by Liberal Arts Instructional Technology Services at the University of Texas at Austin. The current installation at UT Austin includes over 4 million pieces of metadata about 300K+ audio, video, images, and document files. Public beta release
is scheduled for Dec 2008.

## What technologies does DASe use? ##

DASe is written in PHP and can use MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite as a backend. The DASe code base also includes some client utilities written in Python (including a small GUI file uploader) written in Python.
