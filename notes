suhosin.server.encode

When activated (which is the default) the SERVER variables REQUEST_URI
and QUERY_STRING will be scanned for the characters < > ' " and `. All
these characters are usually encoded by the browser before they are sent
and therefore many applications consider REQUEST_URI and QUERY_STRING
safe. However some browsers like Internet Explorer will not encode
these characters which results in lots of XSS vulnerabilities. Suhosin
will protect applications that wrongly put too much trust into these
variables by URL-encoding them within the variables.

[DASe note: this escaping ALWAYS happens with xslt transforms]
But...prefer "value-of" rather than "copy-of" if/when possible since
"copy-of" makes a deep copy and could conceivably copy in javascript

the Dase_Atom libraries
have essentially replaced the
need for alternative persistence models
(Atom *is* the alternative persistence model)
Feed::load represents xml model
Feed::retrieve represents remote model

current code organization:

sdase/
      inc/
          routes.php
          config.php
      handlers/
          collection.php
          item.php
          ...etc
      xslt/
          collection/
                  list.xsl
                  browse.xsl
          item/
                  transform.xsl
          ...etc

reorganize code into modules:

core and add-ons (called modules)

so...

sdase/
        core/
                user/
                collection/
                item/
                attribute/
        module/
                auth/
                vrc/
                elucy/

each module is set up like:

user/
        routes.xml
        controller.php
        xslt/

how about we NOT have item_type identifying attribute and parent attribute stated in item_type table but rather follow a convention that an item type's identifying attribute will always be one of:

<item_type>_id
<item_type>_title
<item_type>_name

dase thought: for multi-collection searches, simply return the first
'hits' for each collection (ajaxily displayed).

so...most dase operations can happen w/in a single collection
thus, there are 3 modes:

1. intro/all: search across all collection, see dase-wide docs, etc
uri: dase.laits.utexas.edu/
2. specific collection: all complex search/refine as well as browsing
uri: dase.laits.utexas.edu/collection_ascii_id
3. user-specific/tags
uri: dase.laits.utexas.edu/username

2006-12-21 22:19:32 

need to keep working on the dase uri scheme (look at del.icio.us!!)

thought for today: probably not-so-simple to cache xml right to
filesystem, since that'd mean apache writes to doc root 

so 3 tiers: 

1. no previous request & app generates xml, prints to browser AND data
directory

2. xml match in data dir -- retreive and sent to browser

3. xml file on filesytem in doc root. had been copied there from data
dir by a batch process

PunBB has a nice explanation in their plugin directory w/ advice about
creatign plugins

Well, be careful of ajax calls/displays, since they break the back
button.... Rule of thumb: can you hit reload and consider what coems up
to be the "same" page??

I think it'll work ok to just split off the personalization stuff form
the content stuff.  Yes, both will need to be loaded, BUT the content
will be asynchronous so you won't have to wait so long to start seeing
stuff.  Besides, we can cache separately.

Lucene search is slower than the original dase approach.  As I read things now (and with the experience of implementing PHP/Lucene) I think that my original approach was the correct way to go for now.  I DO think that I will keep item-level xml docs in the dat_dir, though, and that I can do interesting xmlish stuff with those.  But the things that the RDBMS gives me (concurrent read/write, distributed instance) cannot be replaced with a filesystem on NFS. Keep looking at things like "Solr" though -- if we do 'plug-in' search, it'll need to be a web service, I think.

Need to get back on this and get it done.  Will it be performant?
